akka-http-examples
==================

Few examples on using akka-http

* simple - very basic example of a single project build based on https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/release-2.3-dev/akka-http-tests/src/test/scala/akka/http/server/TestServer.scala, with sbt-revolver enabled

Todo:
* multi-project build, with an API and common code
* multi-project build, with static content based on sbt-web
